# Redbus-Data-Scraping-with-Selenium-Dynamic-Filtering-using-Streamlit
This project aims to revolutionize the transportation industry by providing a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing bus travel data. By utilizing Selenium for web scraping, this project automates the extraction of detailed information from Redbus, including bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability. 
Approach:
Data Scraping:
Use Selenium to automate the extraction of Redbus data including routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability.
Data Storage:
Store the scraped data in a SQL database.
Streamlit Application:
Develop a Streamlit application to display and filter the scraped data.
Implement various filters such as bustype, route, price range, star rating, availability.
Data Analysis/Filtering using Streamlit:
Use SQL queries to retrieve and filter data based on user inputs.
Use Streamlit to allow users to interact with and filter the data through the application.
Results:
You should aim to:
Successfully scrape a minimum of 10 Government State Bus Transport data from Redbus website using Selenium. Also include the private bus information for the selected routes.
Store the data in a structured SQL database.
Develop an interactive Streamlit application for data filtering.
Ensure the application is user-friendly and efficient.
